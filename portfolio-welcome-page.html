      I am currently 18 years old. I am on a gap after completing my studies at <strong>Aylsham High School</strong> and <strong>Norwich School</strong>.
      I am going to study <em>theoretical physics</em> at university. 
      I am interested in coding - specifically in <em>html</em>,<em>css</em> - of which I have plans to explore <em>python</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>C++</em>, and <em>R</em>. I attend <strong>Codebar</strong> workshops each month and attend MOOCs run by <strong>CodeFirstGirls</strong> - notably an introduction to python and machine learning.
      In my soare time I am also involved in work experience with the <strong>Castle  Museum and Gallery</strong>. Also I am a member of the <strong>UEA Choir</strong> and <strong>Cliftonville Singers</strong> as well as taking my Grade 8 in singing.
      This page is a Portfolio to express the projects I have been doing towards physics, mathematics and coding.
